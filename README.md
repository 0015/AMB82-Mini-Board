### Getting started it from Arduino IDE

> You can refer to this link to get started: https://www.amebaiot.com/en/amebapro2-amb82-mini-arduino-getting-started
> , or follow the steps below.

1. **Add Ameba Arduino SDK link to *Arduino IDE Additional Boards Manager***

    > Arduino IDE 1.6.5 and above versions support third party hardware so please make sure to use the latest Arduino IDE for better experience.

    Therefore, you need to add Ameba Arduino SDK link in 
    
    **"File" -> "Preferences" -> "Additional Boards Manager URLs:"**

    Copy and paste the following link into the field and click "OK",

    https://github.com/ambiot/ambpro2_arduino/raw/main/Arduino_package/package_realtek_amebapro2_index.json

    > We also suggest to enable "Show verbose output" options on "compilation" and "upload" in Preference for easier debugging.
    
    </br>

2. **Install Ameba board in *"Board Manager"***

    Open **"Tools" -> "Board" -> "Board Manager"**, wait for it to update additional hardware configurations, then type **"ameba"** in the search bar, you will see Realtek Ameba in the list.

    Press **"Install"** to start the installation.
    
    </br>

3. **Select your Ameba model in *"Tools" -> "Board" -> "AmebaPro2 ARM (32-bits) Boards"***

    > Make sure you select the correct model for your board, otherwise your program might not work properly 

    Now you are **ready** to develop and upload firmware onto Ameba.

### Object detection that running in stand-alone (Yolo v7 Tiny)

0. Libraries required
    > **Arduino TJpg_Decoder library** https://github.com/Bodmer/TJpg_Decoder

    To draw the JPEG image buffer to the display, we need to decode it. Unfortunately, it does not yet support the "Ameba Pro 2" architecture, so you need to modify the User_Config.h file for a successful build.

    > open "/src/User_Config.h"
    
    > remove "#define TJPGD_LOAD_SD_LIBRARY"


1. Load source code
   > Get the demo source code from ths src folder.

   > Open src/Standalone_Object_Detector_v1 in your Arduino IDE.
